This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.2.




## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS) — recommended: Node 18 or 20. Check with:

```bash
node --version
```

- **npm** (comes with Node). Check with:

```bash
npm --version
```

- **Angular CLI** (optional but recommended globally):

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
# or verify with:
ng version
# If you don't want a global install you can use npx:
# npx -p @angular/cli ng version
```

> Tip: Use a version manager (nvm / nvm-windows) if you need to switch Node versions safely.

## Development server

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
ng serve
# or, if you don't have the CLI globally installed:
# npx ng serve
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:4200/
```

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

If you encounter `ng: command not found`, either install the Angular CLI globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`) or use `npx ng serve` to run it without installing globally.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
